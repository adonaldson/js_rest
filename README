JS_REST (For want of a better name).

Problem:
It can be a right pain to make sure the UI stays in sync with the appication state once JS is more heavily used in your app.

Proposed solution:
Provide a simple way to create classes in JS that represent the models in your application and provide access to CRUD actions. Additionally provide a means to trigger code to run when your model is updated.
